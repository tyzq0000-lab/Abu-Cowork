/**
 * Registry adapter interface — the contract any third-party skill
 * source (CLAWhub for now, future registries later) implements.
 * Adapters are pluggable so adding a new registry is a single new
 * file + one call to `registerAdapter()`.
 *
 * Design choices worth knowing
 * ----------------------------
 * - `install()` returns the `.askill` bytes rather than writing to
 *   disk itself. All install flows converge on `unpackSkill()`
 *   (packager.ts), which handles validation, conflict detection,
 *   and atomic write. An adapter that wrote to disk directly would
 *   bypass that hardened path.
 *
 * - `isAvailable()` is async and non-throwing. Adapters may need to
 *   run a command or check a binary path to decide; they should
 *   swallow errors and return false rather than bubbling up. This
 *   keeps the "which registries can I use right now?" UI snappy
 *   even when some registries are offline / misconfigured.
 *
 * - No global token / auth handling here. If a registry needs a
 *   token, it stores / reads it through the settingsStore using a
 *   key scoped by adapter id (`skillRegistries.<id>.token`). The
 *   adapter interface stays clean.
 *
 * Adapters must not be registered automatically from this file —
 * bootstrap happens in a callsite that the app controls, so the
 * test suite can register mocks without importing the real ones.
