/**
 * Global registry of RegistryAdapters.
 *
 * Module-scoped Map acts as the in-memory registry. Bootstrap code
 * (a callsite in App initialization, not in this file) calls
 * `registerAdapter()` for each adapter the build wants shipped.
 * Tests register mocks via the same entry point.
 *
 * Separation of concerns:
 *   - `types.ts`     — what an adapter looks like
 *   - `index.ts`     — who tracks them (this file)
 *   - `<name>.ts`    — individual adapters (CLAWhub, future ones)
 *   - `bootstrap.ts` — which adapters this build ships with
 *
 * We deliberately don't export a `getAdapter()` by id that throws —
 * UI code consistently does "show if present" rather than "crash if
 * absent", so `getAdapter` returns `undefined`.
